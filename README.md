# Game-Programming-Patterns

**INTRODUCTION**

"At first, the challenge was just getting something working. Then, it became figuring out how to write programs bigger than what would fit in my head. Instead of just reading about 'How to program in C++, I started trying to find books about how to *organize* programs.

Fast-forward several years, and a friend hand me a book: *Design Patterns: Elements of Re-usable Objects-Oriented Software*. Finally! The book I'd been looking for since I was a teenager. I read it cover to cover in one sitting. I still struggled with my own programs, but it such a relief to see other people struggled too and came up with solutions. I felt like I finally had a couple of tools to use, instead of just my bear hands.

In 2001, I landed my dream job: software engineer at Electronic Arts. I couldn't wait to get a look at some real games and see how the pros put them together. What was the architecture like for an enormous game like Madden Football? How did the different systemss interact? How did they get a single code base to run on multiple platforms?

Cracking open the source code was a humbling and suprising experience. There was brilliant code in graphics, AI, animation and visual effects. We had people who knew how to squeeze every last circle out of a CPU and put it to good use. Stuff I didn't even know was *possible*, these people did before lunch.

But the *architecture* this brilliant code hung from was often an afterthought. They were so focused on *features* that organization went overlooked. Coupling was rife between modules. New features were often bolted onto the codebase wherever they could be made to fit. To my disillutioned eyes, it looked like many programmers, if they ever cracked open *Design Petterns* at all, never got past **Singleton**.

Of course, it wasn't really that bad. I'd imagined game programmers sitting in some ivory tower covered in whiteboards, calmly discussing architectural minutiae for weeks on end. The reality was that the code I was looking at was written by people working to meet intense deadlines. They did the best they could, and, as I grdually realized, their best was often very good."
