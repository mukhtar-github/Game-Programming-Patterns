# Game-Programming-Patterns

INTRODUCTION

"At first, the challenge was just getting something working. Then, it became figuring out how to write programs bigger than what would fit in my head. Instead of just reading about 'How to program in C++, I started trying to find books about how to organize programs.

Fast-forward several years, and a friend hand me a book: Design Patterns: Elements of Re-usable Objects-Oriented Software. Finally! The book I'd been looking for since I was a teenager. I read it cover to cover in one sitting. I still struggled with my own programs, but it such a relief to see other people struggled too and came up with solutions. I felt like I finally had a couple of tools to use, instead of just my bear hands."
